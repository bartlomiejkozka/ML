# Ethical Considerations

## Use of External AI Models
Our application uses an external model (the **"gemini-2.0-flash"** model from the Google Gemini API). Before using the selected model and the implementation process, we carefully read the Google AI principles, which can be found at the link below:

[Google AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=)

We ensure our approach aligns with ethical AI practices.

## Bias and Fairness
Bias in AI refers to systematic and unfair favoritism or prejudice in AI systems, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes. Relying on data to train algorithms introduces a challenge, as data can reflect biases inherent in societal structures (e.g., racism, prejudice, and classism) and historical patterns. 

Regarding equality, we have checked several combinations and algorithms that give the same output independently of the chosen gender. We have made every effort to ensure gender equality in our algorithms. However, due to the previously mentioned issue of bias in the data, we cannot guarantee that this will be effective in 100% of cases.

## Data Privacy
AI data privacy is the practice of protecting personal data from AI systems. It is important to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly. AI systems often require access to large amounts of data, including sensitive personal information. The ethical challenge lies in collecting, using, and protecting this data to prevent privacy violations.

We would like to ensure customers that we do **not** store inputs given during the generation process. Our primary goal is to provide a tool that helps human decision-making rather than replacing human judgment. We prioritize user confidentiality and data security in all aspects of development.

## Responsible AI Use
Our application is designed as an **assistive tool** rather than a **decision-making authority**. We recognize that AI-generated content should be critically assessed and supplemented with human judgment. Users are encouraged to verify outputs and use them as **guidance rather than absolute answers**. 

We continuously assess our system to ensure it aligns with ethical AI principles and benefits users in a responsible and fair manner.

## Transparency
AI transparency helps people access information to better understand how an artificial intelligence (AI) system was created and how it makes decisions. AI transparency is essential for building trust and understanding among users.

Since our application uses an external AI model, we emphasize transparency by openly disclosing our reliance on the **"gemini-2.0-flash"** model and directing users to Googleâ€™s AI ethics framework. We believe that ethical AI should be **explainable** and **accountable**, and we remain committed to ongoing evaluations to ensure responsible AI usage. 

Our application is built with the intention of assisting users while upholding ethical AI standards.
